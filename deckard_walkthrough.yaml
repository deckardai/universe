doc: |
  Documentation of universe.

doc/env_semantics.rst: |
  Environment semantics. Universe environments differ from other
  Gym environments in that the environment keeps running in
  real-time, even when the agent does not call step.

doc/remotes.rst: |
  Remotes. Since the remote part of the environment runs in its
  own server process, managing remotes is an important task. The
  remote can run anywhere - locally, or in the cloud.

doc/protocols.rst: |
  Internal communication protocols. A Universe environment consists
  of two components that run in separate processes and communicate
  over the network. The agent's machine runs the environment client
  code, which connects to the remote environment server.
